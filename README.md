# Double Entendre Detection

**Double entendre** is a figure of speech or a particular way of wording that is devised to have a double meaning, of which one is typically obvious, whereas the other often conveys a message that would be too socially awkward, sexually suggestive, or offensive to state directly.

I am going to focus on sexually suggestive double entendres for two purposes
1. Detection and flagging of such statements (as they are not appropriate everywhere)
2. For making That's what she said jokes (as seen in The Office tv show)

In this project I am going to compare 2 classifiers trained on custom dataset, a Naive Bayes Classifier and another one is an LSTM Network.
